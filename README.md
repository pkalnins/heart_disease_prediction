# Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning

This Jupyter notebook explores data visualization and various machine learning models to predict heart disease using a dataset with 11 common features and a target variable.

**Problem Definition**
- The core problem addressed in this project is to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on their given clinical parameters.

**Data Sources**
- The primary dataset is a modified version of an original dataset found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction), which combines five heart disease datasets.
- The project's approach was inspired by [Fares Sayah's Kaggle project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/faressayah/predicting-heart-disease-using-machine-learning).
- Additional insights were drawn from [Karan Bhanot's article on Medium](https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-presence-of-heart-diseases-using-machine-learning-36f00f3edb2c).

**Key Findings**
- Preliminary analysis indicates that Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models achieved the highest testing accuracy, predicting heart disease with over 86% accuracy.

**Next Steps**
- Future work would involve exploring hyperparameter tuning for the various machine learning models utilized in this project.
